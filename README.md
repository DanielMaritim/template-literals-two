What are template literals and why are they important?

A template literal is a way to concatenate strings while allowing embedded expressions and improving readability.

Template literals is a feature that allows working with strings and variables easy.Template literals are just like regular stings but we close them in backticks and have qoutes.('')

They were introduced to JvaScript with ES6.

They are easy to use and make code more readable

instead of single quotes (') or double quotes (") quotes we use the backtick (`) character. This will produce a new string, and we can use it in any way we want.


// STRING CONCATENATION
console.log('four plus two is ' + (4 + 2) + '.');

// TEMPLATE LITERALS
console.log(`four plus two is ${4 + 2}.`);// "four plus two is 6."
